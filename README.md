# dual-channel-unlock
Dual Channel Unlock unlocks 2 more channels in common toy drones that support a cheap camera. This firmware allows you to use the channels to move servos, activate buzzers, and is open source, so you can make it do whatever you want. I recommend using the ATTiny85 as the microcontroller due to it's size and weight.
